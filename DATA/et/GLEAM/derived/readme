Dataset Name: 
derived GLEAM ET

Variable name: 
et (evapotranspiration)

General information: 
This product was derived from GLEAM V2A daily 0.25 degree dataset. 

Approach:
I simply read et from the raw data files. Meanwhile I converted the original unit to the standard one 
(mm/day --> Kg/m2/s), binned the original 0.25 degree to the final 0.5 degree resolution and also 
converted the daily to the monthly, and saved the final file in netcdf format by the month and the year.
